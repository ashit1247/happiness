1. Applied Genetic Algorithm to obtain the optimal parameters for the ensemble learning model.
2. Trained the classification model using a decision tree, logistic regression, and support vector machine(SVM).
3. Implemented the voting classifier mechanism for calculating the final output class.
4. Ensemble model using genetic algorithm achieved an accuracy of 94.8%, much better than a single classifier model.
